        details: `Revenue Sharing & Payment 11ic will pay out a revenue share on the Commissionable Earnings generated by each customer, as defined by 11ic Affiliate Program commission structure, provided that you maintain in your account as an affiliate, at least six (6) Active Wagering Members in any given calendar month. However, 11ic will reserves the right to withhold an affiliate commission payout in any particular month whether in part or in full, regardless of the 6 qualified active members, if the affiliate is found not to make an effort to promote 11ic more than 2 months as reflected in no NEW wagering members brought in; lack of 11ic banners on the affiliate website; and or lack of any other online and offline promotional activities seen. The commission shall be withheld until there are new wagering members seen in the affiliate account where 11ic shall have the sole discretion to release either a full or a partial of the withheld commission to the affiliate. Any commission that has been withheld for a period exceeding 6 months may be voided at the discretion of 11ic. Active Wagering Members refers to customers that reach a minimum wagering turnover amount equivalent to 5,000 rupees (INR5,000.00) each in any given calendar month. Commissionable Earnings are calculated as 11ic profit, less charge-back, complimentary money, free money offers and other incentives offered to the customer, derived from at least six (6) Active Wagering Members in a calendar month. Charge-back: A credit card holder discovers irregular transactions made on his/her Credit/Debit Card, which was not authorized by him/her. The credit card holder then requests his/her bank to reverse these charges. Charge backs relate to fraudulent use by a third party of the credit card holder's card or card number. "11IC/J9.com Gross Win" is the total of all amounts bet by at least six (6) Active Wagering Members under your affiliate account in a calendar month, minus all amounts won by or paid to your Active Wagering Members. "Charge-backs" are amounts deducted when a customer that is a credit card holder discovers irregular unauthorized charge-backs made on the customer’s Credit/Debit Card, and the credit card holder requests the bank to reverse these charges. Charge-backs may relate to, but are not limited to, fraudulent use by a third party of the credit card holder's card or card number. Should the player process a charge back, the disputed or charged-back revenue will be forfeited and therefore deducted from the total balance due to you for the current month. Should this deduction of the accumulated revenue exceed your current amount due, your balance will then revert to a negative balance, and you will have to earn revenue to cover the charge-back before you can start earning revenue again. A charge back will stay due until the revenue generated by your other players has covered the amount due. You acknowledge that 11ic can only pay out a percentage of their actual profits, not fraudulent revenue. "Bonuses" include complimentary money, free money offers, credits, sign-up bonuses, promotional amounts and other incentives credited to the account of customers. As customers have not actually purchased these amounts, 11ic cannot pay commissions on the same. Should you fail to be entitled to the Commissionable Earnings in accordance with Clauses 4.1, 4.2, and 4.3 above for failure to maintain at least six (6) Active Wagering Members in a given month, you will not generate any commission in the month and the related member's lost will not be brought forward to the following months. Commissionable earnings will be subject to commissions as calculated using the 11ic Affiliate Program commission structure in force from time to time. Negative earnings are carried forward to the next month. Should the affiliate close the month with a positive balance, payment will be issued if it meets the minimum requirements and commissions will be paid on the positive balance. The Commissionable Earnings of the affiliate calculated based on commission structure will be earned on all transactions that the customer undertakes with the merchant, as long as the affiliate remains a member of this affiliate program. Affiliates will not earn any commission from a member’s turnover or win/loss resulting from or connected with any horse racing and casino wagers using the 11ic website.`,
